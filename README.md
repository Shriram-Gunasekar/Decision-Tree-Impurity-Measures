# Decision-Tree-Split Parameters

This repository is a compilation of not commonly used impurity measures for decision trees, providing implementations and explanations for each measure.
Decision trees are powerful tools in machine learning, and understanding different impurity measures can enhance the performance and interpretability of these models in various contexts.

Contains:

Hartley Entropy
Renyi Entropy
Tsallis Entropy
Fractal Splitting
